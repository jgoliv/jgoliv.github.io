Hi! I'm João Gabriel, a data scientist based in São Paulo, Brazil, with a strong passion for problem-solving and a keen interest in leveraging data to drive impactful decisions.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the State University of São Paulo and a master's degree in Mathematics from the State University of Campinas, where I specialized in Algebraic Number Theory. 

In my current role as a data scientist, I use **R**, **Python**, **SQL** and **Julia** for data manipulation, statistical modeling, and automated reporting with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). I work with machine learning using **scikit-learn** and **tidymodels** for model development and evaluation, and have experience in computer vision with **YOLO** and **OpenCV**. I also develop interactive web applications with **Shiny**, focusing on data visualization dashboards and platforms for monitoring models in production, as well as automation of internal processes and managing cloud computing. 

Beyond my technical work, I am also an avid jazz guitarist.
