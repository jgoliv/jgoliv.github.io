Data scientist with a pure math background.

Applied machine learning to fleet safety, building drowsiness prediction models and computer vision systems to detect risky driving behaviors. Built `Shiny` dashboards and automated reporting pipelines with `Quarto` used daily by hundreds of clients.

Now working on data-driven personalized education, tracking student progress and measuring learning outcomes in mastery-based models where students learn independently at their own pace.
