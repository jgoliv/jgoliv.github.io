<p>The <strong><em>Titanic dataset</em></strong> is one of the most well-known datasets in data science publicly available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic"><em>Kaggle</em></a>. It has become particularly popular for binary classification tasks, allowing data scientists and enthusiasts to predict whether a passenger survived or not.</p>
<p>Each row in the dataset represents a passenger, with multiple features. Below is a brief overview of them:</p>

<p>This dataset comes from the <strong><em>Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster</em></strong> competition on <em>Kaggle</em>. When you download it, you will receive three primary files:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>train.csv</em>, containing the training data, which includes the features of the passengers and the target variable. We will use this data to train our model;</p></li>
<li><p><em>test.csv</em>, which, unlike in typical machine learning workflows (where the “test” set is used to evaluate the performance of the model), does not include the <code>Survived</code> column. We will use this data to generate predictions with our trained model and submit these survival outcomes to <em>Kaggle</em> for evaluation;</p></li>
<li><p><em>gender_submission.csv</em>, which provides a sample submission format, where we must include the <code>PassengerId</code> and <code>Survived</code> columns. The values in the <code>Survived</code> column will be the predictions from our model.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here, we will explore how to use this data to build a step-by-step binary classification model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic.</p>

<p>Moreover, you can find the complete code in this <a href="">Jupyter notebook</a>.</p>

<p>In this section, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle missing data and encode categorical variables;</li>
<li>Look for correlations of important numerical features;</li>
<li>Split our data in training and test sets;</li>
<li>Build a pipeline to streamline these processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, we’ll load the data and take a quick glance in its firsts rows and basic statistics.</p>

<p>Using the <code>info()</code> method, we find that the columns <code>Age</code>, <code>Cabin</code> and <code>Embarked</code> have some missing values:</p>

<p>For the <code>Age</code> column we can use an estimator to impute its missing values. To be more precise, we’ll use the <code>SimpleImputer</code> to impute the mean.</p>
<p>The columns <code>Embarked</code> and <code>Sex</code> are categorical so, for a better model performance, we need to transform them into numerical features. We’ll do it by using <code>LabelEncoder</code> and <code>OneHotEncoder</code>.</p>
<p>Using the LabelEncoder in the <code>Sex</code> column will set 0 = female and 1 = male. For the <code>Embarked</code> column, the use of OneHotEncoder’s will split the former column into four different columns: three for each value and one for missing values.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we now remove some features that may not contribute meaningfully to our predictive analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ticket</strong>, <strong>PassengerId</strong> and <strong>Name</strong>: these features do not offer meaningful insights for predicting survival, as they serve only as unique identifiers for each passenger.</li>
<li><strong>Cabin</strong>: while the cabin number information might indicate passenger status, this column has a high variability and a high proportion of missing values. Given its unreliability, we choose to remove it.</li>
<li><strong>Embarked_nan</strong>: this column represent the missing values on the Embarked column, after the use of OneHotEncoder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we can make an analysis of correlation to guide our procedure of splitting the sets of training and testing. For that, we’ll create a copy of our dataset and perform such changes on this copy.</p>

<p>We can observe a strong positive relationship between <code>Sex</code> and <code>Survival</code> (0.543), and a moderate negative correlation between <code>Pclass</code> and <code>Survival</code> (-0.338), which highlights that women had a higher chance of survival, as well as those in higher classes.</p>
<p>You may also notice the positive correlation between <code>Fare</code> and <code>Survival</code>, which is explained by the strong negative correlation between <code>Pclass</code> and <code>Fare</code>: higher fares are associated with upper classes.</p>
<p>With these relationships in mind, we can now move forward with splitting our data into training and testing sets, using stratified shuffle split to maintain a balanced representation.</p>
