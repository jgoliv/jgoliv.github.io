Once you have it, you can use methods to retrieve the element.\nHowever, sometimes elements may not be clickable due to various factors, such as the page still loading, which can lead to errors in automation. To adress this issue, we can use the WebDriverWait module, which allows us to pause the execution until a certain condition is met, such as an element becoming clickable.\nTo wait for an element to be clickable, we can use the following code:\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\n\nwait = WebDriverWait(driver, wait_time)\nwait.until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((by, element)))\nHere, by is the method we’re using to locate the element (like By.ID or By.XPATH), and element is the identifier of the target element.

One effective way to do this is by moving the mouse to the element’s position on the page. For this, we can use the ActionChains class, which allows us to chain together various actions:\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.action_chains import ActionChains\n\nactions = ActionChains(driver)\nactions.move_to_element(element).perform()\nBy creating an instance of ActionChains and calling the move_to_element method, we can move the mouse cursor to the specified element. The perform method is then called to execute the action.\nUsing ActionChains is particularly useful when working with dynamic elements, such as those that reveal additional options or menus upon hover. This ensures that we can interact with elements that may not be visible or clickable until we move the mouse over them.\nAfter moving to the desired element, we can click on it by adding the click() method to the actions chain, before calling perform.\nIf we want to type something into an input field, we can use the send_keys() method. It’s a good practice to use the clear() method to clear any existing text in the input field before filling it:\ninput_field.clear()\ninput_field.send_keys(\"Your text here\")",

You check the price on Amazon, but it’s a bit higher than you’d like.\nWe’ll first navigate to the Amazon website. Once we’re there, we’ll locate the search bar at the top of the page. Next, we’ll enter the title of the book, Hands-On Machine Learning, into the search bar to find the best prices available.\nWe need to instruct Selenium on how to perform these actions!\nFirst, we need to create a Selenium WebDriver instance to control the browser. We’ll use our create_driver function to initialize the instance and navigate to the amazon url.\ndriver = create_driver(url=\"https://www.amazon.com\")\nWith the Amazon homepage loaded, we can now use our move_click_fill and move_click functions to enter the book’s title into the search bar e trigger the search button. After inspecting the page, we retrieved the search bar’s ID, \"twotabsearchtextbox\", and the search button ID, \"nav-search-submit-button\".\nHere’s the code to handle both actions:\nmove_click_fill(\n    driver=driver\n    , by=By.ID\n    , element=\"twotabsearchtextbox\"\n    , value=\"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow\"\n)\n\nmove_click(driver=driver, by=By.ID, element=\"nav-search-submit-button\")\n\nExtracting product prices\nNow that we’ve successfully navigated to the search results page, we need to extract the prices for the relevant products. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the process:\n\nInspect the HTML structure: after opening the Developer Tools and navigating to the Elements tab, take a moment to examine the HTML structure. For Amazon, products are typically organized under the class name \"s-result-item\". Upon further inspection, you’ll discover that the class name for the product titles is \"a-size-medium a-color-base a-text-normal\", while the prices consist of two distinct classes: \"a-price-whole\" for the integer part and \"a-price-fraction\" for the decimal part, as shown in the images below:\n\n\n     \n\n\nExtract the title and price: we can loop through each \"s-result-item\" and extract the infos we want using the find_element method. The idea here is to organize the product titles, prices, and links into a pandas DataFrame object.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# locating all titles, prices and product links\ntitles = driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, \"a-size-medium.a-color-base.a-text-normal\")\nwhole_prices = driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, \"a-price-whole\")\nfractional_prices = driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, \"a-price-fraction\")\nlinks = driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, \"a-link-normal\")\n\n# loop to append data to the DataFrame\ndata = []\n\nfor i in range(len(titles)):\n    \n    title = titles[i].text\n    price = f\"{whole_prices[i].text}.{fractional_prices[i].text}\"\n    link = links[i].get_attribute(\"href\")  # obtaining the product link\n    \n    # appending the data to the DataFrame\n    data.append({\"title\": title, \"price\": price, \"link\": link})\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# displaying the DataFrame\nprint(df)\n\n# closing the driver after collection\ndriver.quit()\nThe output would look something like this:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s next?\nOnce you have the data, the possibilities are endless:\n\nExport to excel: you can save your DataFrame as an Excel file for easy sharing or analysis;\nEmail the data: automate sending the data via email using Python’s smtplib to deliver the Excel file to your inbox;\nSchedule price checks: set up regular price checks (daily or weekly) using jobs to track changes over time;\nDeploy to the cloud: run the script on cloud platforms to automate the process remotely;\nSet price alerts: add conditions to notify you if prices drop below a certain point.\n\nDon’t forget that you can see the full notebook here!\nHappy automating! 🤖",

    "text": "Pie-like charts\nThe most simple chart we can make to represent proportions is the standard pie chart. On echarts, the basic syntax goes like:\n\ndf |&gt; \n  e_chart(Group) |&gt; \n  e_pie(Total) |&gt; \n  e_theme(\"caravan\")\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this crude form, this chart may not be that interesting. In fact, it can be misleading: Notice how the minor difference between groups “C” and “D” is hardly perceived — this is a common issue when using pie-like charts.\nThe most natural way to solve this would be to include a label, that we can do using the label argument in the e_pie function, in which you can specify the label in any form you wish via the formatter argument, that accepts any javascript function.\nHowever, this doesn’t really change the appearance of the plot. We still cannot visually perceive this difference. In this aspect, we can set the roseType = \"radius\" argument to scale the radius of each slice according to its value.\n\nformatter &lt;-\n  htmlwidgets::JS(\n    \"function(params) {\n       return params.name + ' : ' + params.value + ' (' + params.percent + '%)';\n    }\"\n  )\n\ndf |&gt; \n  e_chart(Group) |&gt; \n  e_pie(Total, roseType = \"radius\", label = list(formatter = formatter)) |&gt; \n  e_theme(\"caravan\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWith these adjustments, we can visualize the proportions more clearly, getting insights faster, while we can see more details in the label.\nWith donut charts, we’ll have about the same issues. You can do it in echarts4r by passing any vector of the form c(\"55%\", \"60%\") to the radius argument in the same e_pie function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Cole Nussbaumer says in Storytelling with data1,\n\nWith pies, we are asking our audience to compare angles and areas. With a donut chart, we are asking our audience to compare one arc length to another arc length.\n\nIt may be hard for us to attribute quantitative values in two-dimensional spaces. Simply speaking, even when we can say which category has a “bigger” value based on the size of a segment, angle, arch-lenght or area, it is hard to know by “how much”.\nOne approach to solve this “how much” issue is using horizontal bar charts. However, is worth to observe that the pie-like charts do give us a notion of the “parts of a whole” kind of a thing — that we’ll lose using bar charts.\nWe discuss this now.",

Bar charts also are very good at dealing with multi-layered data, for example: Consider this pizza dataset containing 5 pizzeria and their sales amount by flavour:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we got two categories represent: the Pizzeria and Flavour groups. Using the stacked bar chart, we can better visualize each layering. To do this in echarts4r, just pass the grouped data and explicit the stack = \"grp\" argument in the e_bar function. We can display it both vertically or horizontally:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, it might be better to unstack the bars (usually, to see some trends in data):",

In our context, they are particularly effective for illustrating proportions in data with multiple layers (more than two, especially).",

    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing\nIn this section, we will cover these key steps:\n\nTake a quick look at the dataset’s structure and basic statistics;\nHandle missing data;\nLook for correlations of important categorical and numerical features;\nCreate new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance (Feature engineering);\nEncode categorical variables: convert categorical data into a numerical format for use in our ML models;\nBuild a pipeline using scikit-learn to streamline these processes.\n\nMoreover, you can find the complete code in this repository.\nFirst of all, we’ll load the pandas and numpy libraries, as well as load the train data.\n\nimport pandas as pd, numpy as np\n\ntrain = pd.read_csv(\"files/dataset/train.csv\")\ntrain_copy = train.copy() # good practice\n\ntrain_copy.head()\n\n   PassengerId  Survived  Pclass  ...

We’ll have a look at some:\n\nTicket and PassengerId: These features do not offer meaningful insights for predicting survival, as they serve only as unique identifiers for each passenger.\nCabin: While the cabin number information might indicate passenger status, this column has a high variability and a high proportion of missing values. Given its unreliability, we choose to remove it.\n\nYou might consider the Name to be an irrelevant feature since it acts as another unique identifier for each passenger. However, upon examining the names, we can see that they include various formats and titles. By extracting the title from the passenger names, we can create a new feature called Title. Before we proceed, let’s take a look at its distribution.\n\nLet’s take the opportunity to create a generic bar plot function for categorical variables.\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\ndef barplot(df, variable):\n    var = df[variable]\n\n    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n    sns.countplot(x=var)\n    plt.xticks(rotation=15)\n    plt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\n\n    plt.show()\n\n\nname = train_copy.Name\ntrain_copy[\"Title\"] = [n.split(\".\")[0].split(\",\")[1].strip() for n in name]\n\nbarplot(train_copy, \"Title\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will create a function to categorize the titles into more frequent groups, to include later in our pipeline. This function will extract the titles from the passenger names and then categorize less frequent titles. Titles like Don, Dr, Major, Lady, Sir, Col, Capt, Countess, Rev, Jonkheer, and Dona will be grouped under “Other”. Additionally, we will standardize titles like Mlle, Ms, and Mme to Miss and Mrs, respectively.",
